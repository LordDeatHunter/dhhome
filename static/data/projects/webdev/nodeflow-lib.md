Frontend library for creating flowcharts, graphs, diagrams and similar.

This is a project I've been working on-and-off for a couple of years.\
Currently, I am leveraging a lot of features from [SolidJS](https://www.solidjs.com/), but I am planning to make it more
framework-agnostic in the near future.\
The library is still in its early stages, but it is already usable for simple diagrams and flowcharts. I also have a
couple of example projects that showcase the library's capabilities.

Originally, I just wanted to make a Family Tree app, but found that a lot of the available libraries were lacking
some features that I wanted, so I decided to do what any developer with too much free time would do - make my own
library.\
There's been a lot of refactoring and rewriting (the current version is the 3rd time I started the project from scratch,
the first 2 times being modifications to an existing library that didn't go well), I faced a lot of interesting
challenges along the way, and I am very satisfied with the result so far.

I have a long [TODO list](https://github.com/users/LordDeatHunter/projects/5/views/1) for the project, and am open to
suggestions and contributions.
