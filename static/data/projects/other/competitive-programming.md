During High School, I started participating in competitive programming competitions (in C++), and even won a place in
one of the national competitions, from which I also got a scholarship for university.

From there, I moved on to online problem-solving platforms, such as Project Euler, LeetCode, Advent of Code, and
others.\
This is where I slowly made my shift from C++ to Python, since I found what Python offers a lot more convenient rather
than having to implement everything from scratch in C++.\
Making everything from scratch is fun and how I generally prefer to do things, but after implementing the same thing
multiple times, there's really no point in doing it again.

These days, I'm not very active in competitive programming, but I do still get back to it from time to time, usually
when someone sends me a link to a cool problem and going down the rabbit hole of clicking on related problems after
checking it out.
