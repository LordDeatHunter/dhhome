A website similar to competitive programming sites like Codeforces or LeetCode, but focused on solving problems using Unix commands and shell scripting.

The idea for this came from nowhere during a weekend hackathon. I wanted to create a fun way for people to learn and practice their Unix command line skills, so I came up with the idea of a competitive programming style site focused on Unix commands.

The site contains a terminal-style input where users can type in their commands, which are then executed in a sandboxed environment. The output is compared to the expected output to determine if the solution is correct.

The backend is built using Python and FastAPI, while the frontend is built using SolidJS.

At the moment, the site is still in its early stages, so there's no public deployment. However, the source code is available on GitHub for anyone interested in exploring or contributing to the project.
