A Minecraft mod that adds a large multiblock structure for forging alloys from different metals.

The inspiration for this mod came from Tinker's Construct. It was initially supposed to be part of a larger mod I was working on, but I decided to split it up as it seemed like a useful standalone feature.

After I slowly started moving away from modding, I decided to hand the ownership of the mod to another modder, [gliscowo](https://github.com/gliscowo/), since the mod was still widely used and I wanted it to continue receiving updates.
