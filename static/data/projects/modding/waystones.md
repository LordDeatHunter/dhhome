A Minecraft mod that adds Waystones to the game, allowing players to teleport between them once they are discovered.\
The first version of this mod was made for Minecraft 1.16.5 using Fabric.

Initially, this was a feature of another mod I was working on - a larger RPG mod for me and my friends. After posting a
few screenshots and videos on the Fabric Discord, a lot of people wanted me to make it a standalone mod, since during
that time (around 2020), Fabric was still relatively new and there weren't many mods available for it.

After that, it grew from a simple mod that was meant for me and my friends into a mod that constantly grew in popularity
and was used by many people. Due to that, I am still updating it from time to time, mostly just version updates and bug
fixes, as I don't have the time to add new features to it.
