A Fabric port of the popular Ex Nihilo mod, which adds various mechanics for skyblock-style gameplay, such as sieves, barrels, and crucibles.

The original Ex Nihilo mod was made for Minecraft Forge, and the only Fabric port was for a very old version of Minecraft. I wanted to play a skyblock modpack with my friends on a newer version of Minecraft using Fabric, so I decided to create a port of Ex Nihilo myself.\
The old version was made in Kotlin, so I rewrote the entire mod in Java since that's what I was the most comfortable with at the time.

As the mod was pretty large, along the way another modder, [MattiDragon](https://github.com/MattiDragon), joined in to help with the development. Together, we ported the entire mod to the latest version of Fabric, as well as adding some new features.
