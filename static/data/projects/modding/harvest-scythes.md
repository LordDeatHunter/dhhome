A Minecraft mod for Fabric that adds Scythes to the game, allowing players to harvest crops in a wide area, based on the
tier of the Scythe.

The first version of the mod was 1.16.5, when Fabric was still fresh, and I was still new to modding.\
This mod was part of a larger RPG mod I was working on for me and my friends, and after splitting up some of the other
features into standalone mods, I decided to do the same with the Scythes.

The idea wasn't original, there were plenty of similar mods that did the same for Forge, but since there weren't a lot
of Fabric mods at the time, I decided to also publish this as a standalone mod.\
My idea for updating the mod was to add as much mod compatibility as possible, but that also was a bit of overhead for
future versions, which is partially why I slowed down with updates.
