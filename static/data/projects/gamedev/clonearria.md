## Love2D (Lua)

A clone of [Terraria](https://terraria.org/), remade multiple times in different frameworks.\
The first version was, as far as I can remember, the first proper "game" that I've made. This was in late 2018,
in [Love2D](https://love2d.org/) (Lua), and had features such as:

- Infinite world generation (including caves)
- World saving/loading
- Very basic enemy AI
- Lighting system
- Attempt at fluids
- Inventory and crafting system
- Chat (in singleplayer) with commands

## MonoGame (C#)

The second version was started in 2019 in [MonoGame](https://www.monogame.net/) (C#), and was a complete rewrite of the
Love2D version.\
At the time, I was experimenting with different graphics/game frameworks, and for MonoGame, I decided to remake my
Love2D Terraria clone.\
Rather than focusing on as many features as possible, I decided to focus on each feature individually and try out what
approach works best for each.\
This version didn't have all the features as the Love2D one, but I improved the inventory and storage system a lot, and
experimented a lot more with worldgen, for things such as different stone "biomes" with different ores, attempt at
generating custom tree shapes, and so on.
