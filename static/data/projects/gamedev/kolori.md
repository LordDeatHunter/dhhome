A game made for the 48h game jam, GameJam Plus in 2021, with the theme "Colorful", which won one of the top 3 places from
the community votes.\
The game is about a blob of paint that's trying to dodge incoming erasers and paint the world with its colors, using
buckets of paint to change its color and abilities.

This was our first GameJam where we used MonoGame, and it was very satisfying finishing a game in 48h in a low-level
graphics framework.
