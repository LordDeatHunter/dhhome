A game made for the 48h GameJam Plus game jam, 2021, with the theme "Colorful", which won one of the top 3 places from
the community votes.\
The game is about a blob of paint that's trying to dodge incoming erasers and paint the world with its colors, using
buckets of paint to change its color and abilities.
