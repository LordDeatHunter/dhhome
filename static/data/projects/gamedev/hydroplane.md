A local cooperative 2 player game made for the 48h Global Game Jam 2025, with the theme "Bubbles", where the players (one
submarine, and one geyser) work together to protect the ocean floor from toxic barrels.

This game earned us **1st place** in the Game Jam.

The GGJ version can be found [here](https://lorddeathunter.itch.io/hydroplane).

After the game jam, we continued to work on it, adding more content and features, and eventually releasing it on Steam.
