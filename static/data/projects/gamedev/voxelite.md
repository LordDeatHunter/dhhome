This was the first ever project I started in OpenGL (using [LWJGL](https://www.lwjgl.org/)).\
After experimenting with different graphics frameworks and making Terraria clone(s), I decided to extend to 3D by making
a Minecraft clone.

The project didn't really get far, most I did was a simple multithreaded terrain generation, player movement, block
breaking/placing, and structure (tree) generation.

This was one of the first "big" projects I did. I didn't get far with development, but it was still a valuable
learning experience.

Some time later, I tried to recreate the project in C# using [OpenTK](https://opentk.net/), but I didn't get further
than setting up the base engine and some basic rendering.\
I'd very much like to revisit this project again in the future, with all the new knowledge I've gained since then, and
hopefully turn it into an actual game.
