Random masks from the 3 categories spawn throughout the map at random intervals based on the number of players, and players can pick them up to gain new abilities and change their playstyle.

Players can throw their masks to damage other players if their mask is able to beat the mask of the opponent, or if the opponent has no mask at all. The game features a rock-paper-scissors style of combat, where each mask is strong against one type of mask and weak against another.

Spirits defeat Machines,\
Machines defeat Animals,\
and Animals defeat Spirits.
