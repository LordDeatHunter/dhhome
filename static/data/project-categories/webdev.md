title: 'Web Development'
---

WebDev is something that I had been avoiding for a long time. I used to make simple websites with HTML and CSS during
High School, and until I started my job as a Software Engineer, I hadn't done much involving any of the modern
technologies.

Ever since then, I've been experimenting with various frameworks and libraries, and occasionally starting a new web
project whenever I get an idea that I feel like would benefit from being available publicly on the web.

Other than my personal projects, I've also been involved in the development of websites for other people and
communities.
