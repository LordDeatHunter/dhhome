I've been playing Minecraft ever since the Alpha days, around 2010, and been fascinated by what one can do with mods
ever since I discovered them.

As with GameDev, I initially started by following tutorials and experimenting with existing code when I was younger.

Several years down the line (around 2018), I started making plugins for Bukkit/Spigot servers in Java, and eventually
moved on to making mods for Minecraft using Fabric sometime during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Initially, I wanted to make 1 larger mod for me and my friends, but after sharing some screenshots in the Fabric Discord
server, I got a lot of positive feedback and decided to separate some of the features into smaller mods.

Nowadays, I don't have much time to work on new mods, but I still occasionally try to find time to update my existing
ones.
