As a kid, my first exposure to programming was through experimenting with the source code of existing Flash games.

My GameDev journey "officially" began around 2018, with lower-level graphics frameworks such as Love2D in Lua, PyGame in
Python and MonoGame in C#.

I also started participating in GameJams since around 2020, and over the years I've experimented with various game
engines and frameworks, with my latest focus being on Godot.

Most of the games I have available publicly were made during GameJams, and not much progress has been made on them since then.

My most notable achievements as a team are 1st place, as well as the "Best Programmers" award in my country's local hosting of 2025 and 2023 Global Game Jam.
