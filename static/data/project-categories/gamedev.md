As a kid, my first exposure to programming was through experimenting with the source code of existing Flash games.

My GameDev journey "officially" began around 2018, with lower-level graphics frameworks such as Love2D in Lua, PyGame in
Python and MonoGame in C#.

I started participating in GameJams since 2019, and over the years I've experimented with various game engines and
frameworks, with my latest focus being on Godot, in which I have accumulated over 1200 hours of experience.

My most notable achievements (as a team) are winning 1st place in our country's hosting of Global GameJam 2 years in a row (2025, 2026), as well as winning the "Best Programmer" award in 2023.
